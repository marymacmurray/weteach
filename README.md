## Description 
we_teach is an app for online educators to teach and learn from one another.  Users create an account and can immediately start gleaning experiences and tips from one another about online teaching*.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Phase 1 MVP 
*This is only phase 1 of a larger collaboration project with a group of teachers to create multiple products with one purpose:  Creating, sharing, and iterating on our online pedagogical practices within a supportive community of teachers and learners.

### Must have
* User auth
* Unified styling ([React Material UI](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/ "material UI"))
* Full CRUD operation for the teaching resources table. 
* Read operations for the pedagogical categories table. 

## üåü Phase 1 Post-MVP

### ‚úèÔ∏è Steps to get your frontend up and running 

In the client directory, you can run:

##### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
